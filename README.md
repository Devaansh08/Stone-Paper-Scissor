# Stone Paper Scissors Game
Welcome to the Stone Paper Scissors Game repository! This project is a simple implementation of the classic hand game where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: stone (rock), paper, or scissors. The game is often played to make a decision between two people.

## Overview

Stone Paper Scissors is a fun and straightforward game where each shape beats one of the other shapes and loses to the other one. The rules are:

- **Stone** crushes **Scissors**
- **Scissors** cuts **Paper**
- **Paper** covers **Stone**

The game ends with either one player winning or a draw if both players choose the same shape.
